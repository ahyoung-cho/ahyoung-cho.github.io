                    <p class="lead mb-5" , align = "justify"> I am an Assistant Professor of Environmental Public Policy in the Political Science Department at St. Lawrence University.
                    <br> <br>  My research investigates how racial and ethnic politics shape decision-making in the policy arena, with a particular focus on environmental justice. In my dissertation, I examined how the politics of climate change and racial equity interacts at the city level and how race and ethnicity, gender, and partisanship jointly shape attitudes toward climate change at the individual level.

                    <br> <br> I am also a part of interdisciplinary research projects that are rooted in urban public policy, racial inequities in health outcomes, and identity politics. As a political methodologist, I use various analytical techniques in my research including network, spatial, and text analyses. My co-authored and solo-authored research has been published in The Journal of Legislative Studies and JAMA Network Open.

                    <br> <br> I received my Ph.D. in Political Science from Boston University in May 2024. </p>
